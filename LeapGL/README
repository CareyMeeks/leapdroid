LeapGL provides native graphics execution environment for Android emulators.
The core of LeapGL is a cross platform OpenGL translator. LeapGL translator
originates from OpenGL pipe in AOSP. But we rearchitectured it for better
multi-threading performance and OpenGL compatibility. We also added more
extension support including fence, and various implementation improvements
including memory reducton, bug fixes, etc.

We plan to open source some parts of LeapGL based on AOSP 4.4 tree.
